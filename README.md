# Notepad-Fun-VBS
Some VBS scripts for timepass.<br/>
For virus scripts (Don't worry , they are non malicious and just for fun):<br/>
- Drive ejector : Ejects CD drive again and again.<br/>
- Keyboard lights : toggles caps, num and scroll lock over and over again for a disco effect.<br/> 
- Viru found : Would give a pop saying Virus found over and over again.<br/><br/>

To make them stop:<br/>
open task manager and kill process saying "wscript".<br/>
